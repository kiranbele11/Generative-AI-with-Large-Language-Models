# Generative-AI-with-Large-Language-Models

## Welcome to my Generative AI and LLMs Specialization repository! 
This project showcases my journey through a comprehensive course on Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and their applications. Here, I’ve documented my learning objectives, key concepts, and hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI technologies.

# Overview
This specialization covers the entire lifecycle of Generative AI models, from pre-training and fine-tuning to reinforcement learning and real-world applications. Through this course, I’ve gained a deep understanding of LLM architectures, scaling laws, fine-tuning techniques, and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).

# Key Learning Objectives
## Week 1: Generative AI Fundamentals
-Model Pre-Training: Explored the value of continued pre-training vs. fine-tuning and discussed computational challenges during pre-training.

-LLM Lifecycle: Learned the steps in a typical LLM-based generative AI model lifecycle and the factors driving decisions at each step.

-Scaling Laws: Defined scaling laws and their impact on training dataset size, compute budget, and inference requirements.

-Transformer Architecture: Understood the transformer architecture that powers LLMs and its role in generative AI.

## Week 2: Fine-Tuning and Evaluating LLMs
-Fine-Tuning Techniques: Learned how fine-tuning with instructions using prompt datasets improves task performance.

-Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): Explored how PEFT reduces computational costs and overcomes catastrophic forgetting.

-Catastrophic Forgetting: Defined the concept and studied techniques to mitigate it during fine-tuning.

## Week 3: Reinforcement Learning and LLM Applications
-Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF): Understood how RLHF uses human feedback to improve LLM performance and alignment.

-Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Explored how this technique enhances LLMs' reasoning and planning abilities.

-Knowledge Cut-Offs: Discussed challenges with LLM knowledge cut-offs and solutions like information retrieval and augmentation.
